# üèóÔ∏è Tower of Hanoi - Interactive Game in C++

An interactive C++ implementation of the **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle where users can manually play the game! The game includes a dynamic visual representation of the rods and disks to make gameplay intuitive and fun.

---

## üìã Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can manually play the game by entering moves.
- **Dynamic Visuals**: Disks are represented proportionally using `=` characters, and the rods are labeled for clarity.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures only valid moves are allowed (e.g., no placing a larger disk on a smaller one).
- **Winning Condition**: The game detects when all disks are successfully moved to the destination rod.

## üìñ How to Play

The **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle involves moving disks from one rod to another while following these rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
3. The goal is to move all disks from the first rod (**A**) to the last rod (**C**) using the middle rod (**B**) as needed.

### Example Visualization:
**Initial State with 3 Disks**:
```
      ===     
     =====    
    =======   
      |         |         |     
       A         B         C     
```

**After Moving a Disk (A ‚Üí C)**:
```
      ===     
     =====    
      |         |         =======
      |         |         |     
       A         B         C     
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`) installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of compiling and running C++ programs.

### Installation

## üíª Usage
1. Start the program and enter the number of disks when prompted.
2. Enter moves in the format `A B`, where:
   - `A` is the source rod.
   - `B` is the destination rod.
3. Continue making moves until all disks are moved to rod `C`.
4. Celebrate your win when the game congratulates you! üéâ

### Example Gameplay
**Input**:
```
Enter the number of disks: 3
Enter your move (e.g., A B): A C
Enter your move (e.g., A B): A B
Enter your move (e.g., A B): C B
...
```

**Output**:
```
Congratulations! You solved the Tower of Hanoi puzzle!
```
